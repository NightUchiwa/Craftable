# Craftable
This mod has been created by the creators of Nish.

This mod, (in the process of being created) adds crafting recipes to minecraft that minecraft does not have, such as bedrock crafting.

this mod also adds a new spawn egg for the ender dragon because yes, you too see no use in the egg we find in the end after killing that damn dragon. Obviously the crafting recipes are not too abused to keep a normal survival without too much cheat.
